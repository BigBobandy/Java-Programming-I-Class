/* Lesson Notes and Description: 
    Built upon the previous AssignVolunteer4 application by adding a loop to validate the data entries. 
   The loop ensures that a valid donation code is always entered by the user. 
   If the entered donation code is not valid, the program prompts the user to enter a valid donation code until a valid code is entered. 
   This is achieved through the use of a while loop which checks whether the entered donation code is within the range of valid codes.
 * 
 * Key Points to remember about this lesson:
 * 
 *  The while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition. The loop continues while the condition is true.

    The || operator represents logical OR in Java. It is a binary operator and is used to create a logical expression that is true if either of the conditions is true.

    The nextInt() method of Scanner object is used to get the user input. It is important to handle input validation to avoid any exceptions or errors during the execution of the program.

    Leaving the default case in a switch statement can be beneficial. It can serve as documentation and it prepares the code for possible changes in the program requirements in the future.
