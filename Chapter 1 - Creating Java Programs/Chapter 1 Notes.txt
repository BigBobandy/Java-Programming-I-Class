Here are notes I took while reading and working through Chapter 1.

Application name must match the class name on the class header.

Class name should begin with a uppercase letter and all first letters of subsequent words should be uppercase.

When saving your file in Notepad, make sure to put the .java extension and change the Save as type: to All Files.

When compiling and running your application, make sure are in the same location that you saved the java application.
