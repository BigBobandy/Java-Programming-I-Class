Here are notes I took while reading and working through Chapter 2.

Variable names must use camel casing. Camel casing is where the first word of the variable name should begin with a lowercase letter and all first letters of subsequent words should be uppercase. (ex. firstName)

Named constants must be preceded by the final keyword and consist of all uppercase letters, separated by an underscore and have a value assigned to it. (ex. final int NUMBER_OF_DEPTS = 20)

When using the Scanner class:
    System.in object only reads bytes.
    Scanner class is used to allow the System.in object to accept data of other types.
    Scanner class contains methods for accepting each data type except char.
    nextLine() method should be used to accept the Enter key when following one of the other input methods. (pages 81-83)
