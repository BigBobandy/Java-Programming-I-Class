/*
In this lesson, I improved upon the previous AssignVolunteer3 application by adding more options for donation types and using a switch statement to assign the appropriate volunteer. 

Key points to remember about this lesson:
1. Switch statement is a multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.
2. The 'break' keyword is used to exit the switch case. If break is not added after each case the program will continue executing the next case even if the expression does not match.
3. A 'default' case can be included which will be executed if none of the cases match.
